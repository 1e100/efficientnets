# Efficient Nets

Note at this time this is a work in progress, although EfficientNet is 
already functional. Eventual goal here is to have the simplest implementation
of EfficientNet and EfficientDet suitable for easy integration into other
projects.

In the meanwhile check my [MobileNet V3](https://github.com/1e100/mobilenet_v3)
or [VoVNet2](https://github.com/1e100/vovnet_v2) implementations. The latter 
is not well known, but it shows outstanding generalization performance in my
object detection work, as well as very strong accuracy on the initial training
set.
